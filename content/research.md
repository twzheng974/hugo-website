### <p style="text-align: center"> Privacy in the Modern World </p>

<p style="text-align: left">
In the modern world, technology is what connects everyone - and everything - to the Internet. However, ignorance of privacy has cost people. People have posted insults towards others for greed and attention, only to find out they got fired the next day for their public actions. Or maybe, one of the fancy new “smart” furniture in one’s house is actually spying on them unknowingly, all because they ignored the fine print completely. Privacy is “the right to be left alone” (qtd. in Gervais) and is important in the growth of personalities and creativity (Gervais 27). But with the increase of technological growth, privacy is constantly challenged (Siegel 1). Internet users must place privacy as their highest technological priority due to the flippancy that inherently comes with egoism, the growth of technological development, and the increase in government surveillance utilizing those technologies.

<p style="text-align: left"> 
Social media is possibly the most prominent violator of internet privacy primarily due to the lack of care from the users. Often, this is because of the user’s need for self-gratification. Users’ need of entertainment can frequently cause privacy concerns to be overridden, due to the users’ inability to constrain themselves (Chen and Kim 807). This can be the need for sharing pictures of themselves for comments or linking Facebook or Twitter to games and other sources of entertainment for rewards. Also, users believe that in order to make the most out of social media, one must share private information in the face of potential risk (Quinn 62-63). This behavior is known by some researchers as the “Privacy Paradox,” where users are heavily concerned about their online privacy, but contradict themselves due to unwillingness of configuring their privacy settings within the network (Quinn 63). The ignorance of privacy concerns will be more likely exchanged for the benefit of social media (Chen and Kim 807,810). Through this act of selfishness, solely for the sake of entertainment, the users greatly risk their own privacy.

<p style="text-align: left"> 
The information that was once shared on the internet can easily be shared over the cyberspace. “Over 900 million active users on Facebook alone voluntarily share private information not only with select groups of friends, but also with the company itself” (Siegel 1). This content is often sold by companies to maintain their social network with no transparency (Quinn 61), making it impossible for the common users to prevent their private data from being released to advertisers and the government upon request (Siegel 1). Even just a small amount of information like name, date of birth, and a single image of oneself can reveal that person through the process of re-identification (Gervais 28). This information, if spread to smaller, more insecure companies, could drastically increase the risk of identity theft by cybercriminals.

<p style="text-align: left"> 
Internet browsers and websites also utilize a feature called cookies meant for an improved web-browsing experience. Cookies are innate functions that allow the tracking of activities of users on the website, which can be used to personalize advertising and search engines, and is often used in social media (Gervais 27-28). This tracking is a direct violation of privacy, making even the simplest action on the internet insecure. Seventy-three percent of the users oppose search engine tracking and sixty-eight percent of the users are against personalized advertisements from cookies tracking (Gervais 28). There are options within the browser to disable cookies, but while this ability exists, only thirty-eight percent knows how to block cookies with two percent actually blocking them permanently (Gervais 28). This relates to the “Privacy Paradox” mentioned earlier, where the users are aware but ultimately unwilling to act.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left"> 
On the contrary, there are claims that the “Privacy Paradox” is shrinking. More users are actively using methods such as manipulation of privacy settings, restricting status updates to others, and managing multiple accounts and profiles (Quinn 63). This allows users to selectively filter out who is undeserving of their content. Nonetheless, research has shown that there is no correlation between the opinion and behaviors of users’ concern of privacy due to the vast underestimation of the network size (Quinn 63). While the users are starting to become active in protecting themselves in the public sphere, the constantly growing number of social media users would distort the perception between attitude and actions. This can be reinforced by the fact that users still permit applications and programs access to the photo album or other information like contacts and location even with concern (Quinn 63).

The creation of social media is due to the growth of technology, allowing larger servers to host the platform. Along with that, cellular data and price drops of technology have allowed all to be connected. However, this progress comes with the cost of privacy. Along with privacy-breaching improvement to internet browsing, “smart” technology is making its way into people’s homes in such ways as an internet-capable refrigerator for recipes or a TV hooked up to an ethernet cable for the best Netflix experience. With this technology, people are transitioning into the era of the “Internet of Things,” defined by the Federal Trade Commission as an “interconnected environment where all manner of objects have a digital presence and the ability to communicate with other objects and people” (qtd. in Williams). This will drastically increase the data collected by companies within a household due to the lack of legal framework requiring the need of personal privacy (Williams). This spying is only legal because in the fine print of the “smart” machines, where the corporation includes a term that asks for permission to survey, this agreement is often overlooked by many. A controversy erupted in early 2015, when Samsung’s Smart TV privacy policy warned about potential eavesdropping in the house (Williams). If companies are willing to stealthily slip this warning in, it is likely that they have little regard for the public, but rather their own financial success.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left"> 
In spite of that, the aforementioned upgrades can benefit the everyday user. Smart technologies often offer convenience, productivity, protection, and health (Williams). Voice control, fingerprint readers, iris scanners, and light and motion sensors all offer at least one of these said benefits. Nevertheless, there are still flaws in the present day. Recent research shows that of the most frequently-used devices in the “Internet of Things,” sixty percent of them had major security vulnerabilities, which included privacy issues (Williams). Even life-saving utilities such as pacemakers and insulin pumps can also be hacked, posing a major threat to people’s safety (Williams). Due to the lack of investment in privacy from both the manufacturers and the government, Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act could prevent hobbyist hackers and security researchers from developing a functional patch that can fix newly found flaws (Williams).

<p style="text-align: left"> 
This technological progression also grants the government more possibilities for surveillance. Along with collecting data from third parties for national security, they want users to sacrifice their individual privacy, which allows the government to have a better chance of detecting asymmetric threats like terrorism (Siegel 1). This lack of respect for individual privacy shows that the government would prioritize the security of their nation above the well-being of the people. Any sensible person would, of course, oppose this, but according to Siegel’s study, frequent users of social media are more willing to lose their privacy (4). This can become a serious threat to the common people: “a state in which the government may be watching or tracking [the people] at any time” (Williams). Therefore, a balance between privacy and security must be maintained. Also, with the presence of “smart” devices, the data collected by these devices may be used by the government to enforce laws (Williams).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left"> 
This national security does allow a safer life in the real world, however. Anti-terrorism policies in conjunction with anti-privacy policies allow the government to prevent threats from unknown sources (Siegel 1). While this allows a safe life out in the physical world, this restriction in the cyberworld will prevent conversations in confidentiality. Without proper regulation on surveillance, this will lead to a constant surveillance on everyone, a direct violator to privacy and democracy as a whole (Williams).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left"> 
In the modern world, privacy is a growing issue. The apathy from the people and the lack of enforcement in pro-privacy policies results in an insecure experience in the cyberspace. Social media, technological improvements, and government surveillance all pose threats to personal privacy, where protection should be prioritized by internet users. Any form of privacy breach on an individual will increase the likelihood of further breach in the future. Take the small decisions seriously now to prevent the current trend toward a state of constant surveillance of the people.
